	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <!-- <p>Write a brief summary about the quality of the data set here</a></p> -->
        <p>The overall quality of the data is good, but not great. The collection process got interrupted from time to time due to weak cell phone signals. Overall, the data is coherent and correct as evidenced by the data visualization.</a></p>

	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<p>
    The data is mostly complete. However, it should be noted the data collection process got interrupted from time to time in areas where the phone signals were not strong enough. This might potentially jeopardize the comprehensiveness and fairness of the data.

      </div>
      
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<p>
  The data is mostly coherent. I verified this by looking up the geocoordinates of the locations with the highest number of records. For my data visualization, I used circles of different sizes to represent different levels of record numbers for each location. By looking up the geocoordinates of the two largest circles(the two locations with the most visits), I found out that these two places were my home address and school address. This confirmed my expectation.

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<p>
  The data is mostly correct. I verified this by checking the data points against my daily activities during the collection period. For my data visualization, I color-coded the data for each day during the collection period. For example, the data points for March 2nd (denoted by color pink) mostly center around my apartment address. This is accurate because March 2nd fell on a Friday and I stayed home all day. Another exmple would be March 1st (denoted by color orange). I went to my friend's apartment that day and this is again evidenced by the location of orange data points on the map.
